# Analysis: Tools vs Prompt Resources Conversion

## Summary

You were absolutely correct to question whether tools that only return prompts should be converted to prompt resources. After thorough analysis:

## Current Tool Analysis

| Tool | Function | Should Convert? | Reason |
|------|----------|----------------|---------|
| `get_weather` | ❌ Keep as tool | No | Performs HTTP API calls |
| `convert_c_to_f` | ❌ Keep as tool | No | Mathematical computation |
| `list_canonical_queries` | ❌ Keep as tool | No | Returns structured data |
| `classify_canonical_query` | ❌ Keep as tool | No | Complex pattern matching logic |
| **`get_query_template`** | ✅ **Convert to prompts** | **Yes** | **Only returns prompt templates** |
| `get_office_dataset` | ❌ Keep as tool | No | Returns actual data |
| `get_filtered_office_data` | ❌ Keep as tool | No | Filtering logic + data |
| `validate_query_parameters` | ❌ Keep as tool | No | Validation logic |

## Key Finding

**Only 1 out of 8 tools** should be converted to prompt resources:
- `get_query_template` → Multiple prompt resources (one per canonical query)

## Why This Conversion Makes Sense

### ✅ **Semantic Correctness**
- Templates ARE prompts, not computed results
- Better aligns with MCP protocol design
- More intuitive for developers

### ✅ **Architectural Benefits**  
- Clear separation: tools for logic, prompts for templates
- Direct access to prompt content via MCP protocol
- Better resource management

### ✅ **Implementation**
```python
# Before (tool):
template_result = await mcp.call_tool("get_query_template", {"query_name": "revenue_stats"})

# After (prompt resource):  
prompt_result = await mcp.get_prompt("revenue_stats_prompt", {})
```

## New Architecture

### Current (Mixed)
```
1. classify_canonical_query (tool) → query type
2. get_query_template (tool) → prompt + params  ← TOOL RETURNING PROMPTS
3. get_filtered_office_data (tool) → data
4. Client executes LLM
```

### Improved (Semantically Correct)
```
1. classify_canonical_query (tool) → query type
2. revenue_stats_prompt (resource) → raw template  ← PROPER PROMPT RESOURCE
3. Client does parameter substitution
4. get_filtered_office_data (tool) → data  
5. Client executes LLM
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better MCP Compliance**: Using prompt resources for prompts, tools for logic
2. **Cleaner Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **More Maintainable**: Prompts are managed as proper resources
4. **Future-Proof**: Aligns with MCP best practices

## Implementation Files Created

- `mcp_server_canonical_with_prompts.py` - Server with prompt resources
- `rag_agent2_canonical_with_prompts.py` - Client using prompt resources

The conversion successfully transforms the one inappropriate "tool that returns prompts" into proper MCP prompt resources while keeping all actual logic-performing tools as tools.
